# Aevatar Agent Framework Constitution

## 🌌 Preamble

We, the architects and contributors of the Aevatar Agent Framework, establish this constitution to define the immutable principles, core architecture, and evolutionary pathways of a distributed agent system that transcends traditional boundaries between intelligence and infrastructure.

## 📜 Article I: Foundational Principles

### Section 1: Core Axioms
1. **The Agent is the Unit of Intelligence** - Every agent (GAgent) is a self-contained, autonomous entity with its own state, behavior, and communication patterns.
2. **Events are the Language of Reality** - All communication between agents occurs through events, creating a universal language for distributed consciousness.
3. **Actors are the Infrastructure of Scale** - The Actor model (GAgentActor) provides the execution environment enabling massive horizontal scaling.
4. **Streams are the Nervous System** - Event streams form the neural pathways through which information flows in the agent network.
5. **Hierarchy Enables Emergence** - Parent-child relationships allow complex behaviors to emerge from simple agent interactions.

### Section 2: Design Imperatives
1. **Protocol Buffers are Mandatory** - All serializable types MUST use Protobuf for cross-runtime compatibility
2. **Abstraction Before Implementation** - Define interfaces first, implement providers second
3. **Event-Driven by Design** - Synchronous calls are the exception, not the rule
4. **Runtime Agnostic** - Same agent code must work across Local, Orleans, and ProtoActor
5. **AI-Ready Architecture** - The framework must seamlessly integrate with LLM and AI capabilities

## 📐 Article II: Architectural Doctrine

### Section 1: The Trinity of Execution
```
GAgent (智能体 - Intelligence)
    ↓
GAgentActor (执行器 - Executor)  
    ↓
Runtime (运行时 - Infrastructure)
```

### Section 2: Event Propagation Laws
1. **UP Direction**: Events flow to parent's stream, broadcasting to all siblings
2. **DOWN Direction**: Events flow to own stream, broadcasting to all children
3. **BOTH Direction**: Simultaneous UP and DOWN propagation
4. **Loop Prevention**: Events from parent streams cannot propagate back UP

### Section 3: Memory Hierarchy
1. **State Memory**: Agent's persistent state (Protobuf-encoded)
2. **Event Memory**: Historical event stream with deduplication
3. **AI Memory** (when applicable):
   - Short-term: Conversation history
   - Long-term: Vector embeddings
   - Working: Current context

## 🛡️ Article III: Naming Covenant

### Section 1: The Aevatar Namespace
All public interfaces and types in AI modules SHALL bear the "Aevatar" prefix to:
- Prevent collision with third-party libraries
- Assert ownership and origin
- Enhance discoverability

### Section 2: Naming Patterns
- Interfaces: `IAevatar*` (e.g., `IAevatarLLMProvider`)
- Base Classes: `Aevatar*Base` (e.g., `AevatarAIAgentBase`)
- Core Types: `Aevatar*` (e.g., `AevatarChatMessage`)
- Enums: `Aevatar*` (e.g., `AevatarAIProcessingMode`)

## ⚡ Article IV: Performance Mandates

### Section 1: Optimization Priorities
1. **Event Deduplication** - Prevent duplicate processing using efficient caching
2. **Subscription Management** - Unified mechanism with retry and health checks
3. **Lazy Evaluation** - Defer computation until absolutely necessary
4. **Batching** - Group operations where possible
5. **Streaming** - Prefer streams over collections for large datasets

### Section 2: Resource Management
1. **Memory Constraints** - Implement sliding windows and expiration
2. **Connection Pooling** - Reuse connections across agent communications
3. **Backpressure** - Implement flow control in high-throughput scenarios

## 🔮 Article V: AI Integration Charter

### Section 1: AI Agent Principles
1. **Provider Agnostic** - Support multiple LLM backends through abstraction
2. **Tool Composability** - AI tools must be discoverable and chainable
3. **Memory Persistence** - AI context must survive agent restarts
4. **Prompt Engineering** - Templates and optimization as first-class citizens

### Section 2: Processing Modes
1. **Standard** - Single LLM call with optional tools
2. **Chain of Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning with transparency
3. **ReAct** - Reasoning + Acting in iterative cycles
4. **Tree of Thoughts** - Parallel exploration of solution spaces

## 🌊 Article VI: Stream Dynamics

### Section 1: Stream Ownership
Every GAgentActor SHALL:
1. Own exactly one stream for broadcasting
2. Subscribe to parent stream when relationship established
3. Maintain subscriptions to children streams
4. Implement resume mechanisms for disconnections

### Section 2: Event Envelope Protocol
Every event SHALL be wrapped in an EventEnvelope containing:
- Unique identifier
- Source agent ID
- Timestamp
- Direction indicator
- Payload (Protobuf Any)

## 🔄 Article VII: Evolution Protocol

### Section 1: Backward Compatibility
1. **Never Break Existing APIs** - Deprecate, don't delete
2. **Protobuf Evolution** - Only add optional fields
3. **Version Negotiation** - Support multiple protocol versions

### Section 2: Extension Points
1. **Custom Runtimes** - New actor frameworks can be integrated
2. **AI Providers** - New LLM providers can be added
3. **Tool Ecosystems** - Domain-specific tools can extend base capabilities
4. **Memory Backends** - Alternative storage can be plugged in

## 🧪 Article VIII: Quality Assurance

### Section 1: Testing Mandates
1. **Never Delete Failing Tests** - Fix them instead
2. **Test Across Runtimes** - Ensure portability
3. **Simulate Failures** - Test resilience and recovery
4. **Benchmark Performance** - Measure and optimize

### Section 2: Code Quality
1. **Async All the Way** - No blocking calls in async contexts
2. **Null Safety** - Explicit nullability annotations
3. **Resource Disposal** - Implement IDisposable where appropriate
4. **Logging** - Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Section 3: Version Management
1. **No Version Suffixes in Code** - Never use "V2", "V3" etc. in class names
2. **Direct Updates Only** - Update existing implementations directly
3. **Deprecation Over Duplication** - Mark old APIs deprecated, don't create new versions
4. **Single Source of Truth** - One implementation per concept

## 🌍 Article IX: Community Governance

### Section 1: Contribution Principles
1. **Design Documents First** - Major features require design docs
2. **Incremental Progress** - Small, focused PRs over monoliths
3. **Documentation** - Code without docs is incomplete
4. **Examples** - Every feature needs usage examples

### Section 2: Decision Making
1. **Consensus Preferred** - Seek agreement through discussion
2. **Data-Driven** - Benchmarks and metrics guide decisions
3. **User-Centric** - Developer experience is paramount
4. **Future-Proof** - Consider long-term implications

## 🚀 Article X: Mission Statement
